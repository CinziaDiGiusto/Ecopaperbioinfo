To uncover their structural design principles, we defined {\textquotedblleft}network motifs,{\textquotedblright} patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks. We found such motifs in networks from biochemistry, neurobiology, ecology, and engineering. The motifs shared by ecological food webs were distinct from the motifs shared by the genetic networks of Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae or from those found in the World Wide Web. Similar motifs were found in networks that perform information processing, even though they describe elements as different as biomolecules within a cell and synaptic connections between neurons in Caenorhabditis elegans. Motifs may thus define universal classes of networks. This approach may uncover the basic building blocks of most networks.},

abstract="We study an operator for refinement of actions to be used in the design of concurrent systems. Actions on a given level of abstraction are replaced by more complicated processes on a lower level. This is done in such a way that the behaviour of the refined system may be inferred compositionally from the behaviour of the original system and from the behaviour of the processes substituted for actions. We recall that interleaving models of concurrent systems are not suited for defining such an operator in its general form. Instead, we define this operator on several causality based, event oriented models, taking into account the distinction between deadlock and successful termination. Then we investigate the interplay of action refinement with abstraction in terms of equivalence notions for concurrent systems, considering both linear time and branching time approaches. We show that besides the interleaving equivalences, also the equivalences based on steps are not preserved under refinement of actions. We prove that linear time partial order semantics are invariant under refinement. Finally we consider various bisimulation equivalences based on partial orders and show that the finest two of them are preserved under refinement whereas the others are not. Termination sensitive versions of these equivalences are even congruences for action refinement.",

abstract="Resources are defined as submultisets of Petri net markings. Two resources are called similar if replacing of one by another doesn't change the net's behavior. Two resources are called similar under a certain condition if one of them can be replaced by another without changing an observable behavior provided that a comprehending marking contains also some additional resources. The paper studies conditional similarity of Petri net resources, for which the (unconditional) similarity is a special case. It is proved that the resource similarity is a semilinear relation and can be represented as a finite union of linear combinations over a finite set of base conditional resource similarities. The algorithm for computing a finite approximation for conditional resource similarity relation is also presented.",

abstract="Structural analysis of biochemical networks is a growing field in bioinformatics and systems biology. The availability of an increasing amount of biological data from molecular biological networks promises a deeper understanding but confronts researchers with the problem of combinatorial explosion. The amount of qualitative network data is growing much faster than the amount of quantitative data, such as enzyme kinetics. In many cases it is even impossible to measure quantitative data because of limitations of experimental methods, or for ethical reasons. Thus, a huge amount of qualitative data, such as interaction data, is available, but it was not sufficiently used for modeling purposes, until now. New approaches have been developed, but the complexity of data often limits the application of many of the methods. Biochemical Petri nets make it possible to explore static and dynamic qualitative system properties. One Petri net approach is model validation based on the computation of the system's invariant properties, focusing on t-invariants. T-invariants correspond to subnetworks, which describe the basic system behavior.",

  abstract={In this thesis twenty basic legal stories are modelled into Petri nets to compare them in terms of different similarities. 
Label and structural similarity are implemented and there results are ranked in matrices. Beforehand the stories are ranked by a person and the results of the computational measures and are correlated with the use of Spearman’s rank correlation algorithm. Label similarity has the highest correlation because subject and events are important for human comparison instead of the complexity of the story. However label comparison is still a mechanical way to compare stories and the execution comparison measure would probably be higher correlated because of a better representation of the story flow.This thesis concludes that label similarity is a better way to compare stories then structural similarity.}
